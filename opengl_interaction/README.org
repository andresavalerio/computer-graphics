** Exercises
1. Write a program that prints a blue dot with a size of 5.0 at the position where a left mouse button click occurs. Initially, the dot should be at coordinates (0,0).
2. Write a program that performs two functions: printing the dot at the mouse coordinates from exercise 1 and changing the dot's color. Again, the initial color of the dot is blue, and it is located at coordinates (0,0). To change the color, the user will type the keys from 0 to 9. Each key should correspond to pre-selected indexed colors. Choose the colors as you wish.
3. Create a program with two functions: one to print a line between any two points and another to change the line's color. An initial blue line between the points (0,0) and (0,0) should be drawn. The line's position changes according to the coordinates given by an initial click and a final click with the left mouse button. Colors are selected in the same way as in exercise 2.
4. [OPTIONAL] Create a program that contains the same two functions as exercise 3, changing the color and drawing lines. This time, there is no initial line, and the initial color is the one at index 0. Every two left mouse button clicks, a new line is drawn without erasing the previous ones.
5. Write a program that contains three functions: the line drawing and color-changing functions from exercise 3, and a function to draw triangles. Initially, a blue line with coordinates (0,0) - (0,0) should be printed. Only one figure should be displayed on the screen at a time, and previous figures are erased. If the user presses the 'r' or 'R' key, the line drawing function is activated. If the user presses the 't' or 'T' key, the triangle drawing function is activated. The process for drawing lines continues in the same way as in exercise 3. For drawing triangles, the three vertices are determined by three consecutive left mouse button clicks.
